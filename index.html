        <p>Hello my name is Garrett Phoonswadi and I have a Bachelor's degree in computer science and Biological Science from Colorado State Univeristy. I recieved my Biology degree in 2013, and my Computer Science degree in 2017. After earning my Biology degree I went into radiology research focusing on radiations affect on cancer cells. During my stretch in research I performed many different experiments and collected massive amounts of data. I started to get interested in computer science when trying to quantifiy the data I was collecting. This was a fun time in my college career. I was published in 2015 and traveled to Japan for a short amount of time to continue my research. After Japan I decided to study Computer Science</p>

        <p>I Started studying computer science in 2014. In 2015 I started an internship at HP in the Storage division. I worked for HP until 2016 when the company split into Hewlett Packard Inc. and Hewlett Packard Enterprise. I stayed on the same team working for HPE. I took a spring semester off in 2016 and worked full time for HPE. After that I returned to CSU to finish my degree. I have since continued work on the same team as a full-time employee working in Boston. My future goals are to combine both of my degrees to push research to the next level!</p>

      <h2>Ray Tracer</h2>
      <p>This ray tracer was build from scratch in c++ if you are interested in it I have it posted on github. It still needs a little fine tunning but it can draw some nice pictures.</p>
